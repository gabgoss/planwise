# planwise

**Your AI project manager that never forgets.**

planwise is a plugin for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) that helps you plan, execute, review, and track your work across sessions. It keeps everything organized in simple markdown files so nothing gets lost between conversations.

---

### The problem

Ever had Claude Code forget what you were working on? Started a new session and had to re-explain everything? Watched tasks pile up with no way to prioritize them?

**planwise fixes that.** It gives your projects a persistent memory — structured plans, scored backlogs, and lessons learned that survive across every session.

---

## Step 1 — Initialize planwise in your project

Navigate to the project you want to manage, open Claude Code there, and run:

```
/planwise init
```

Claude will ask you a few questions:

1. **Project name** — just type your project's name (e.g., `my-cool-app`)
2. **Planwise root directory** — where to store planwise files (default: `planwise/` in your project root — just press Enter to accept)
3. **Directory names** — for Plans, Backlog, and Lessons Learned (defaults are fine)

Once done, you'll see a new folder structure in your project:

```
your-project/
  planwise/
    config.yaml          <-- your project settings
    Plans/               <-- where session plans live
    Backlog/             <-- where tracked items go
    LessonsLearned/      <-- where insights are saved
  .claude/
    rules/
      planwise/          <-- 10 rules that help Claude work with your plans
```

> **You only need to run `init` once per project.** After that, planwise remembers your setup.

---

## Step 2 — Start using planwise

Here's what you can do now. Each command starts with `/planwise` followed by a subcommand.

---

### Create a plan

```
/planwise plan my-new-feature
```

This walks you through creating a structured session plan. Claude will ask about:
- What abbreviation to use (like `APP` for app features, `BUG` for bug fixes)
- How many sprints you need
- What tasks go in each session

Your plan gets saved as organized markdown files you can review anytime.

> **What's a sprint?** A group of related work sessions. If your feature is small, one sprint with one session is enough. Bigger features might need multiple sprints.

**Scaffold from an existing Discovery phase:**

```
/planwise plan --scaffold APP
```

This takes a Discovery plan you've already written and automatically builds out all the sprints and tasks from it.

---

### Review a plan before executing it

```
/planwise review
```

This sends your plan through a two-phase AI review:

1. **Structural review** — checks that files are named correctly, links aren't broken, and the plan hierarchy makes sense
2. **Content review** — checks task quality, token estimates, dependencies, and success criteria

You'll get a report with an **APPROVED** or **CHANGES REQUIRED** verdict.

> **Why review?** Catching problems in a plan is much cheaper than catching them mid-execution. Think of it like proofreading before you hit send.

---

### Execute a plan

```
/planwise run
```

This starts working through your planned tasks in order. You get two modes:

- **GUIDED mode** — Claude proposes each task and waits for your OK before doing it (recommended for your first time)
- **DELEGATED mode** — Claude works through tasks automatically using a task-runner agent

If you need to stop mid-session, don't worry — planwise saves a recovery file so you can pick up exactly where you left off.

---

### Manage your backlog

```
/planwise backlog
```

Opens an interactive view of all your tracked items, scored and prioritized. For each item, you choose a route:

| Route | When to use | What happens |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **A — Direct Fix** | Small bugs, quick changes | An AI agent fixes it right away |
| **B — Task List** | Medium scope work | Breaks it into steps and works through them |
| **C — New Plan** | Large features or overhauls | Creates a full plan for it |

**Filter your backlog:**

```
/planwise backlog --priority High
/planwise backlog --status IN_PROGRESS
/planwise backlog BUG-042
```

---

### List all your plans

```
/planwise list
```

Shows a table of every plan in your project with its status, sprint count, and when it was created.

---

### Work with lessons learned

**Search your lessons:**
```
/planwise lessons database migration
```

**Capture a lesson mid-session:**
```
/planwise lessons capture
```

**Promote a lesson to a formal rule:**
```
/planwise lessons promote LL-003
```

> **What are lessons learned?** When something goes wrong (or right!), planwise can capture that insight so you don't repeat mistakes or forget what worked.

---

### Get help

```
/planwise help
```

Shows all available commands at a glance and links to this full user guide.

## Quick reference

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/planwise init` | Set up planwise in your project (once) |
| `/planwise plan [name]` | Create a new session plan |
| `/planwise plan --scaffold [abbrev]` | Build a plan from a Discovery phase |
| `/planwise review` | AI-review a plan before running it |
| `/planwise run` | Execute a planned session |
| `/planwise backlog` | Triage and work on backlog items |
| `/planwise list` | See all plans and their status |
| `/planwise lessons` | Search, capture, or promote lessons |
| `/planwise help` | Show available commands and link to user guide |

## How it works under the hood

planwise is built entirely on markdown files and Python scripts — no databases, no servers, no external services. Everything lives in your project folder and gets version-controlled with your code.

### Custom agents

planwise uses four specialized AI agents behind the scenes:

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **structural-reviewer** | Validates plan file structure, naming, and cross-references |
| **plan-reviewer** | Deep content review — task specs, estimates, dependencies |
| **task-runner** | Executes individual tasks during plan runs |
| **fix-agent** | Applies targeted code fixes for small backlog items |

You don't need to interact with these directly — they're called automatically when you use `/planwise review`, `/planwise run`, and `/planwise backlog`.

### Configuration

After running `/planwise init`, your settings live in `planwise/config.yaml`. Here are the key things you might want to customize:

| Setting | What it controls | Default |
|---------|-----------------|---------|
| `project.name` | Your project name (used in headers) | Set during init |
| `abbreviations` | Category prefixes for plans (APP, BUG, etc.) | 4 defaults |
| `scoring` | How backlog items are scored and ranked | Sensible defaults |
| `build_commands.default` | Command to verify builds after changes | `echo '...'` |

## Updating planwise

To get the latest version, run:

```
/plugin marketplace update
```

Then reinstall:

```
/plugin install planwise@planwise-marketplace
```

---

## Uninstalling

To remove the plugin:

```
/plugin uninstall planwise
```

To remove the marketplace:

```
/plugin marketplace remove planwise-marketplace
```

> **Note:** Uninstalling the plugin does **not** delete your `planwise/` project folder or any of your plans, backlogs, or lessons. Your data is always safe.

## Troubleshooting

**"Command not found" when typing `/planwise`**
- Make sure you installed the plugin from the marketplace
- Run `/reload-plugins` or restart Claude Code to activate newly installed plugins

**"Config not found" when running a subcommand**
- Run `/planwise init` first — most commands need the project to be initialized

**Python scripts show errors**
- Check that Python 3.8+ is installed: `python --version`
- If you see YAML-related warnings, install PyYAML: `pip install pyyaml` (optional but silences warnings)

**Plans or backlog seem out of date**
- Run `/plugin marketplace update` then reinstall to get the latest plugin version

**Not sure which command to use?**
- Run `/planwise help` to see all available commands and a link to the full user guide
